#  Snake Game in Java

This is a classic Snake game built using Java and the Swing framework. The game features smooth movement, colorful UI, score tracking, and increasing difficulty as the snake grows longer. Perfect for learning the basics of Java GUI programming and game logic.

##  Features

-  Classic Snake movement  
-  Random apple generation  
-  Collision detection (self and walls)  
-  Score tracking  
-  Custom tile-based background  
-  Keyboard controls (arrow keys)  
-  Java Swing GUI

  




##  Technologies Used

- Java 8+
- Java Swing (`JFrame`, `JPanel`, `Timer`, `Graphics`)
- Object-oriented programming principles

##  How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Java JDK** installed.

2. Compile the project:

    ```bash
    javac SnakeGame.java GameFrame.java GamePanel.java
    ```

3. Run the game:

    ```bash
    java SnakeGame
    ```

You should see a window titled **"Snake"** open with the game running.

##  Controls

-  Left Arrow — Move Left  
-  Right Arrow — Move Right  
-  Up Arrow — Move Up  
-  Down Arrow — Move Down  

Avoid crashing into the walls or your own body. Each apple eaten increases the snake's length and your score.
